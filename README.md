This project demonstrates file handling operations in Java using standard I/O and NIO libraries. The application performs basic file manipulation tasks such as writing, reading, and modifying text files.
The program creates a text file, writes content into it, reads and displays the content, then modifies specific words in the file and displays the updated content.
This project highlights practical implementation of Java file handling concepts including:

File creation and writing using FileWriter

Reading file content using BufferedReader

Modifying file content using Files and Paths (NIO package)

Exception handling using try-catch blocks
